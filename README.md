# Olist Digital Marketing

## Objective
- To create visual reports on order number, sales, customer acquisition
- To make customer segmentation based on purchase behavior (RFM model)

## Background
The dataset was provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on Olist website: www.olist.com

Business process: after a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.
